# Analyses of Brazil's Hospital Appointments Data using Python libraries -Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc.
#### by Chimmuanya Mogbo

## Dataset:

This dataset provides data on over an hundred thousand hospital appointments in Brazil. It contains various information on patient personal data and general health conditions. 
This data is contained in a csv file downloadable from a udacity-hosted page [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042118000). 

## Summary of Findings 
In the exploration some of the findings that I made include: 

The vast majority of patients in this sample were not alcoholics, that is over 10,000 people. Percentage attendance among non-alcoholics was about 0.05% higher compared to patients that were alcoholics. Proportionally, there was no significant difference in compliance to appointments between the alcoholic group and the other patients.
Attendance was up by almost 9% in the category of patients that were reminded of their appointments by SMS compared to those that were not reminded.
Also, There was a greater attendance rate among scholarship-holders compared to their non-scholarship holding counterparts.
Generally, average attendance fell gradually with increasing patient disability and was lowest amongst the most disabled category.
In general, patients with appointments were by far mostly younger and middle-aged persons. The smaller the age, the more the number of patients. There were very few patients above the age of 90.

### Limitations: 
No statistical tests were done in this project, therefore these findings do not prove causation. However, there are several instances of correlation.
